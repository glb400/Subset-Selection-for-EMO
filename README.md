## General information

This repository contains the implementation of paper [Subset Selection for Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10079175). It includes our GSEMO-ACC framework. Part of codes use the open-source toolkit from HisaoLabSUSTC in https://github.com/HisaoLabSUSTC/BenchSS.


## Code

### Algorithms for Quality Indicators

```
Code for GSEMO-HV: GSEMOHV.m
function [RecordHV,RecordR2,Subset,time]=GSEMOHV(PopObj,selNum,r,W)
+ PopObj: the set of candidate solutions.
+ selNum: the constraint on the number of selected solutions.
+ r: reference point.
+ W: the set of direction vectors for hypervolume approximate indicator.


GSEMO-ACC-IGD: GSEMOIGD.m
function [Record,Subset,time]=GSEMOIGD(PopObj,selNum)
+ PopObj: the set of candidate solutions.
+ selNum: the constraint on the number of selected solutions.

Code for GSEMO-ACC-IGD+: GSEMOIGDp.m
function [Record,Subset,time]=GSEMOIGDp(PopObj,selNum)
+ PopObj: the set of candidate solutions.
+ selNum: the constraint on the number of selected solutions.

Code for GSEMO-ACC-R2: GSEMOR2Tchebycheff.m
function [RecordR2Tch,Subset,time]=GSEMOR2Tchebycheff(PopObj,selNum,r,W)
PopObj: the set of candidate solutions.
selNum: the constraint on the number of selected solutions.
r: Utopian point.
W: the set of weight vectors for R2 indicator.
